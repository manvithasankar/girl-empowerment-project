          <img src={pepperspray} alt="Pepper Spray" style={{ marginBottom: "40px" }} />

          <p>
            <strong>
          Pepper spray is a powerful self-defense tool that can temporarily incapacitate an attacker.
It works by causing severe irritation to the eyes and respiratory system.
This sudden reaction gives you precious seconds to escape from danger.
Always be mindful of the wind direction before using it.
Practice using your spray in a controlled environment so youâ€™re fully prepared in an emergency.

          <h2>Tip 2: Use Nearby Objects as Weapons</h2>
          <img src={weapon} alt="weapon" style={{ marginBottom: "40px" }} />
          <p>
            <strong>
          In a dangerous situation, use objects around you to defend yourself. A handbag, umbrella, water bottle, keys, or even a mobile phone can serve as weapons to strike an attacker and create an opportunity to escape. Aim for sensitive areas like the eyes, nose, or groin to cause maximum impact. Stay alert and aware of your surroundings to quickly grab an object if needed.

          <h2>Tip 3: Learn Physical Defence (Karate/Kung Fu)</h2>
          <img src={karate} alt="karate" style={{ marginBottom: "40px" }} />
          <p>
            <strong>
          Learning basic self-defense techniques such as karate or kung fu empowers you to protect yourself physically.
Regular training builds not only strength and agility but also boosts your confidence.
It teaches you how to disable an attacker quickly by targeting vulnerable areas like the knees, groin, or eyes.
These skills are invaluable in a critical moment when verbal warnings may not suffice.
Investing time in self-defense training can be a lifelong benefit for your personal safety.

          <h2>Tip 4: Stay Strong & Self-Motivated</h2>
          <img src={strong} alt="strong" style={{ marginBottom: "40px" }} />
          <p>
            <strong>
          In a threatening situation, your mental strength is as vital as your physical ability.
Staying calm and thinking clearly helps you assess the situation quickly.
Positive self-talk reinforces your determination and aids in overcoming fear.
Mental preparedness allows you to act decisively and effectively under pressure.
Remember, a focused mind can be your strongest defense when physical options are limited.
